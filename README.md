# Basic hands-on with Tensorflow

This project provides a basic hands-on introduction to TensorFlow, an open-source end-to-end machine learning library.

## Overview

TensorFlow is a powerful tool for preprocessing data, modeling data, and serving models. This project covers fundamental concepts such as tensors, variables, and basic operations. It also demonstrates how to create random tensors, reshape matrices, perform matrix multiplication, and access GPUs for computation.

## Features

* Introduction to TensorFlow and its core concepts.
* Creating and manipulating tensors using `tf.constant()` and `tf.Variable()`.
* Generating random tensors with `tf.random()`.
* Performing matrix multiplication with `tf.matmul()`.
* Reshaping and transposing tensors.
* Typecasting tensors with `tf.cast()`.
* Calculating basic statistics (min, max, mean, sum, etc.).
* Accessing GPUs for accelerated computation.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* NumPy

## Installation

1. Install TensorFlow using pip: bash pip install tensorflow==2.13.0
2. 2. Install NumPy using pip: bash pip install numpy==1.25.2

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.
2. Run the code cells in the notebook to explore the different concepts and functionalities of TensorFlow.
